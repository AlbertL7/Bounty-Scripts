## Domain Slicer Python

### Features 

- Scans a list of URLs from a text file.
- Checks the status codes of the URLs.
- Optionally follows redirects. 
- Generates output files based on the status codes.

NOTE: When following redirects 301 / 302 and a valid response occurs, final ULR will show up in 200.txt. If you do not use "-redirects" it will show up in its applicable status code file ex: 301.txt / 302.txt.
